# Savina Apps in CAL

Run Savaina benchmarks using Tycho and the CAL actor language.

To run all the experiemnts execute `python3 scripts/runExperiments.py` from the terminal. Note this can take hours to run, so be ready. 

All apps here taken from the Savina Actor Benchmark paper.

    abstract = {This paper introduces the Savina benchmark suite for actor-oriented programs. Our goal is to provide a standard benchmark suite that enables researchers and application developers to compare different actor implementations and identify those that deliver the best performance for a given use-case. The benchmarks in Savina are diverse, realistic, and represent compute (rather than I/O) intensive applications. They range from popular micro-benchmarks to classical concurrency problems to applications that demonstrate various styles of parallelism. Implementations of the benchmarks on various actor libraries are made publicly available through an open source release. This will allow other developers and researchers to compare the performance of their actor libraries on these common set of benchmarks.},

# Requirements
1. [streamblocks-tycho](https://git.cs.lth.se/dataflow/streamblocks-tycho) on the LU gitlab servers has been installed and you are using branch "EntityRenamingBug" branch. We use the the tychoc binary in the streamblocks-tycho repo, not the streamblocks binary in the [streamblocks-platforms](https://git.cs.lth.se/dataflow/streamblocks-tycho/-/tree/EntityRenamingBug) repo to build.
